    "            - layer-1 device\n",
    "            - receives a signal from 1 system and sends the signal to all other ports on th hub.\n",
    "            - drawback; uses up bandwidth by sending th data to every port on the hub\n",
    "            - security issue\n",
    "            - creates a \"shared\" network segment that all systems have access to.  Cause domain collision\n",
    "            \n",
    "         - Switch\n",
    "            - connect all systems together in a network environment\n",
    "            - layer-2 device that filers traffic by the layer-2 address (MAC address or hardware adddress that is assigned to the network card by manufacture\n",
    "            - The switch is able to filter th traffic because it stores the MAC address of each system connected to the switch and what port that system is connected to in the MAC address table. \n",
    "             - MAC address table is a table stored in memory on the switch and is responsible for tracking what ports each system is connected to\n",
    "             - Collision Domains\n",
    "                - Switch creates a collision domain that is its own network segment.  Because no other system is on the network segment, there won't be data collision.\n",
    "                - a group of network systems that share the same network segment and therefore can have their data collide with one another.\n",

    "               - When a system is connected to a port on the switch, it becomes a member of the VLAN that the port is associated with.\n",
    "               - cannot communicate across VLAN without a router\n",
    "           - Router\n",
    "               - layer-3 device of the OSI\n",
    "               - responsible for routing or sending data from one network to another network.\n",
    "               - use a routing table that resides in memory to determine the networks that the router knows how to send data to\n",
    "               - network devices that define the boundary of the network by creating what is called a broadcast domain.  A broadcast message is a message that is destined for all systems.\n",
    "               - is strategically placed on the network to keep those broadcast messages within your network because broadcast traffic does not pass through the router.\n",
    "           - Load Balancer\n",
